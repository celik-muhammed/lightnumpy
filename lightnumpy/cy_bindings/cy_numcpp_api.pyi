# cy_numcpp_api.pyi
# Cython Stub File (.pyi) (like Python type hints for Cython) (Optional)
# Purpose: .pyi files are used for type hinting and provide
# a pure Python interface for Cython modules.
# They serve a similar purpose to Python type hints but specifically for Cython.
# Usage: These files contain the declarations of classes and functions
# without implementation details, allowing tools like type checkers (e.g., mypy)
# or IDEs to understand the types and signatures of the functions
# and classes in the corresponding .pyx files.

# cdef inline void cy_char_to_print(const char* message = b"Hello, from Cython .pxi file!")  # Stub for print function
